Student Goals
=============

When asked what their goals were for the course, students responded:


**Python / Programming**

* Become more familiar with utilizing Python
* get more programming experience
* to gain programming experience to be ready for the industry
* Get more practice and knowledge about programing
* have good programming project experience and figure out python
* Improve upon my programming skills and learn Python
* Gain experience in using python language for software development
* Improve my programming and learn Python
* Expand my programming knowledge for personal projects and prepare myself for the job market
* Improve my programming and algorithm skills



**Python for Data Science**

* I'm hoping to create an in depth project that utilizes python in hopes of using it to go into data science
* get more familiar with python and applying that to real life situations that could be helpful for the future
* good programming experience. I want to go into cancer research, so i'd like to learn how to use TACC's machines to handle big data


**Technologies**

* I want to learn Docker, databases, and more about APIs to be well equipped for software engineering jobs. Also this is a degree requirement for me
* k8s
* Get familiar with building web apps
* Learn about relevant computational methods.
* Gain a better understanding of cloud computing technologies
* Be more familiar with cloud computing and gain more experience in python to be prepared for the industry
* I want to learn more programming skills, specifically Kubernetes, and work on projects that can contribute to a portfolio!
* learn how to effectively use workflow resources to better my coding skills
* Learn more about cloud computing and improve software dev knowledge
* To broaden my skills in programming, specifically in cloud computing and workflow management in general
* I have previous experience using virtualized systems both locally (XCP-NG) and on AWS, but have not done much with containers.  I am especially interested in learning about docker and k8s!


**Software Engineering**

* Build a complex computing system
* Be able to work in software engineering
* Understand what I did to finish the final project and be able to apply it
* I want to learn more about software engineering rather than just computation methods in order to create in depth projects
* Be able to build a complete software application the proper way
* learning more about programming applications
* learn how different languages connect to create a final product
* To understand how to create useful and larger scale software


**This Person Gets It**

* Most of my degree has been overly academic and not particularly practical; this class seems like it will provide something more that I desperately need.




Good news: You are all in the right place.
