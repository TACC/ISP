Grading:
Homework: 20%
Minor Projects: 30%
Final Project: 35%
Participation: 15%

Challenges/Homework/Project Info:
Challenges
graded only towards participation points, graded on a scale from 0 to 3.
0 : Didn't turn in
1 : Attempted, but doesn't run
2 : Attempted, but doesn't give correct results
3 : Perfect, everything runs an intended
Homework
accounts for 20% of your grade
are built from the challenges
base concepts required for projects.
graded on a scale from 0 to 10
The Minor Projects
accounting for 30% of your grade
are built from the homework
*may* require some independent research to complete
graded on a scale from 0 to 100

Examinations:
There are no written exams for this class, there are two midterm projects and one major project


Attendance:
Attendance is not required, however homework assignments are built from the hands on labs, missing the labs will make completing the homework that much more difficult.
If you are going to miss class due to an academic event (conference, job fair) please give the instructors 2 weeks notice, so they can better prepare for classes.
The class will be *strictly* online until 09/21, check Canvas for Zoom links.
After 09/21, we'll see.
Office Hours:
If you need help from an instructor, reach out to us on Slack, make an tutorial request on #isp-fall2021-qa


Special Notes:
We are scientists, we go where the data goes.
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TDD or the Cockrell School of Engineering Director of Students with Disabilities at 471-4321.
Evaluation:
Note that the Measurement and Evaluation Center forms for the Cockrell School of Engineering will be used during the last week of class to evaluate the course and the instructor. You may also want to note any other methods of evaluation you plan to employ.
